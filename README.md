# CS319-Club-Manager-Group3J-Group1
This is a student club management system for CS319 project of Bilkent University.
It aims to provide a well-organized and user-friendly interface to students, in order to facilitate their membership operations. A student can view the pages of existing clubs, be informed about the aim and organizations of clubs, and apply for membership for one or more different clubs. Moreover, it enables every student to create a club if it is approved by the head of student affairs. After the approval, student becomes the owner of the club, who can assign elder role to some students aiming to help with regard to editing the club page, make members aware of the upcoming activities, and manage memberships. Ultimately, a club can be dissolved by either the owner of the club or by student affairs.
There also could be  a feature where students can create a calander for themselves by including their courses, planned other activities and club events to be able to manage their schedules easily.
